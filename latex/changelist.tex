\sublevel{Differences to version 1.18}
\begin{itemize}

% Version 1.20
\item new \OSC{syncFrame} synchronisation mode. See section \fullref{syncPos} and \fullref{syncFrame}.
\item the \OSC{events} system has been extended to any object attribute and supports user defined events.
  This change comes also with a one tick delay introduced to handle all the events (i.e. the 
  event associated messages are processed by the next time task): this is intended to avoid
  freezing the system in case of loops. See section \fullref{attributeevents} and  \fullref{userevents}.

  consistency, especially for message based variables: an object state remains now consistent 
  from one message to another.

\item new \OSC{radius} message supported by rectangles. See section \fullref{rectobjects}.

%:    Differences to version 0.50
\sublevel{Differences to version 0.50}
\begin{itemize}
\item Graphic signal thickness is now symmetrically drawn around y position.
\item ITL file format supports regular expressions in OSC addresses.
\item IP of a message sender is now used for the reply or for error reporting.
\item new \OSC{line} object (section \fullref{setsect}).
\item new \OSC{penStyle} message for vectorial graphics (section \fullref{specificMsg}).
\item new color messages \OSC{red, green, blue, alpha, dcolor, dred, dgreen, dblue} (section \fullref{common} and  \fullref{relpos}).
\item color values for objects are bounded to [0,255]
\item \OSC{get map} message behaves according to new map message (section \fullref{getsect}).
\item \OSC{get width} and  \OSC{get height} is now supported by all objects (section \fullref{getsect}).
\item  bug in signal projection corrected (index 0 rejected)
\item  bug in signals default value delivery corrected
\item  new \OSC{pageCount} message for guido scores
\item  debug nodes modified state propagated to parent node (corrects the debug informations graphic update issue)
\item rational values catch null denominator (to prevents divide by zero exceptions).
